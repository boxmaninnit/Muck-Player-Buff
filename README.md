# The Muck Player Buff

## Installation
Go to releases, then select the most recent release. Once you have installed from the most recent release, you need to unzip the file and then copy the .dll to muck\muck_data\managed in your muck folder (make a backup of the original assembly-csharp.dll), and then the changes will take place, keep in mind if your playing with friends they will have to install this mod as well.


## Properties of the mod
Increases speed, damage, (maybe) health.


## Editing source code (the .dll file)
You won't be able to see the source code directly from github, so you will have to install the .dll, then open it in a .dll editing program (I use dnSpy, you can find it on github).


## The .dll doesnt work
The game has been updated and I need to upload the updated release.
